## About the project
TibiaPal is a website for players of an old school video game 'Tibia'. 

The site is intended to have a number of features to help with the day-to-day life of the players.
Current features include:
- 'TibiaLootSplit', which vastly simplifies dividing up in-game loot between all participating players by a simple copy and paste from the game's log. The output is displayed in such a format that the user can immediately copy it back into the game to ease the split. 
- Active house auctions, which make it easier to see at a glance how many active auctions there are on a particular world
- Imbue calculator
- Exp Share calculator
- Stamina calculator
- Leech calculator
- Exp calculator
- Rashid tracker
- Offline training calculator
- Boss Timers
- Hunting Places
- Bestiary Reference
- Weapons Reference
- Exercise Weapons Calculator

The site currently has approximately 100k pageviews a month.
