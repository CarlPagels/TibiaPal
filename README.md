## About the project
TibiaLootSplit is a website for players of an old school video game 'Tibia'. 

The site vastly simplifies dividing up in-game loot between all participating players by a simple copy and paste from the game's log. The output is displayed in such a format that the user can immediately copy it back into the game to ease the split. 

The site currently has approximately 70k pageviews a month.
